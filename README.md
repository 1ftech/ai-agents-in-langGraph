# AI Agents with LangGraph

Welcome to the **AI Agents with LangGraph** project, developed as part of the DeepLearning.AI course. This project explores how to build stateful, multi-step AI agents using **LangGraph**, an innovative framework for building agentic workflows on top of **LangChain**.

## 📖 Project Overview
LangGraph extends LangChain by enabling cyclic, stateful computation using a graph-based model. This project demonstrates how to:

- Create AI agents that reason through complex tasks
- Manage memory and state transitions between agent steps
- Use LangGraph to define conditional logic and loops
- Build interactive and adaptive workflows with LLMs

## 🚀 Features
- Agent creation with memory and tool use
- Directed graph logic for stateful execution
- Integration with LangChain tools and agents
- Demonstration of multi-turn task completion
- Fine-grained control over flow and branching

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **LangGraph** – Agent orchestration
- **LangChain** – LLM interface and tools
- **Python** – Core logic and flow control
- **OpenAI / Hugging Face** – LLM providers (optional)

## 📅 Use Cases Demonstrated
- Multi-step task execution (e.g., writing, planning, summarizing)
- Tool-augmented agents (e.g., using search, calculators)
- Stateful agent loops (e.g., retrying tasks, reflecting)
